			<p class="sectiontitle">Setup for multi-screen mode</p>
			<p class="text">With this game, you have the option to play exactly like on TV - if you have 2 screens connected to your computer (includes projectors), you can use one to control the game and the other fo the contestant to use. The contestant won't be able to control the game and they won't be able to see the controller's button and options. This is more realistic and more like the TV show.</p>
			<ol class="list">
				<li>To set this up, you must configure your PC to 'extend screen' mode. In Windows, press the Windows key and P at the same time. Then select 'Extend'.</li>  
				<li>Open your web browser twice (preferably Google Chrome). Drag one onto the other screen and keep the other on the first screen. Maximise each one so that they fill their screen.</li>
				<li>On your screen, open <a href="controller.html" target="_blank">this</a> page.</li>
				<li>On the other screen (the contestant's one), open <a href="contestant.html" target="_blank">this</a> page.</li>
				<li>Click on each page in turn and press F11 to make it full screen.</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="sectiontitle">Setup for single mode</p>
			<p class="text">If you don't have 2 screens or can't use extend mode, you can still play the game. Just open <a href="controller.html?codeinput='*'" target="_blank">this</a> page and type a * in the code input box (if there isn't one already). Then you can click sync pages and play as normal.</p>
